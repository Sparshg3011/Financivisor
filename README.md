# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) to install node modules.
This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock or shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, with an npm-shrinkwrap.json taking precedence if both files exist.

```bash
npm install
```

## For Front-end 
Use the cd command to navigate into the client folder. 
```bash
cd client\
```
Run the npm install command again install necessary node modules for React JS.
```bash
npm install
```
